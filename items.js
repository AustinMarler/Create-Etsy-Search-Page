Please note that Etsy does not allow for us to change an address on an order so it is the customers responsibility to make sure they have used the correct address.","policy_shipping":"My production to shipment period varies based on the current volume of orders being processed, but is usually 1-2 weeks (that is BEFORE the package is handed over to the USPS). Please always check the store announcement on the front page for up to date information on my current schedule. If you need something rushed or shipped ASAP please contact me BEFORE you make your purchase to find out if the request can be accommodated.\n\nI ship via USPS First Class Mail to the address on your Etsy order (not Paypal - please make sure your Etsy address is correct). This includes Delivery Confirmation (though tracking is not always reliable and some packages will never update in the system). Shipment periods vary depending on your location, and the volume being handled by the USPS at the time. If you&#39;d like to upgrade to either Priority or Express shipment please contact me ahead of time to make necessary arrangements - we can only accept this kind of payment via Paypal (you can pay as a guest if you do not have an account).\n\n* First Class Mail in the US averages 2-5 business days, but can take up to 21 business days. Priority Mail is an average of 2-3 business days, but can also take the full 21 business days. If you purchase and do not upgrade shipping to Express you must be prepared to wait the full 21 business days if necessary - this doesn&#39;t happen too often, but with thousands of packages it does happen often enough that I cannot afford to replace every package that takes the full 21 days. The USPS is what it is, we in the US all have to accept its limitations. The only guaranteed USPS service is Express Mail - which is guaranteed to arrive in 2 days of shipment.\n\n* First Class Mail Internationally averages 2-3 weeks, and Priority Mail Express averages 6-10 business days, but both can take up to 3 months if a package is stopped by your customs enforcement. The only guaranteed service is Express Mail, which is 3-5 days, but that can still be stopped by customs enforcement for additional customs charges.\n\nFor status updates on your order, please check under &quot;Your Account&quot; - &quot;Purchases&quot; & you&#39;ll get an update on if your item was marked shipped, and when. You will receive an automatic shipment notification from Etsy when your order is ready to hit the mail.\n\nItems are placed in a silver organza bag, and a padded envelope for delivery. If you&#39;d prefer your item to be gift wrapped, that is a $2 additional charge per piece. \n\nPlease note: Shipments to Canada have been notoriously slow over the last couple of years, with some packages taking up to 6 weeks to reach their destination. \n\nCUSTOMS DUTIES: All customs duties are to be paid by the buyer. All items will be marked as merchandise, so please do not ask if I will mark it as a gift for you. If you&#39;d like to avoid delays or paying customs duties my only suggestion is that you make multiple purchases and I will be happy to ship separately as long as the shipping is paid for by the buyer. Please remember, it is the responsibility of the buyer to be aware of the customs duties and limits of their country as they are the one importing the item(s). I&#39;m very sorry, but there&#39;s no way for me to know the customs duties for every country in the world. :(\n\nUK CUSTOMERS especially should note that nearly all packages that exceed a value of 15 pounds sterling will be stopped and you will be charged an 8 pound fee plus 20% VAT.","policy_refunds":"I strive to satisfy all my customers needs and will do whatever I can to correct an issue if I am at fault in any way. If you are unhappy with your item because of my own mistake I will be happy to replace it, or issue a full refund. \n\nIf you do have any concerns about your order please contact me before leaving feedback so that I may address the issue.** I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;re a tiny shop and so we cannot accept returns for any reason other than our own error.\n\n**The black fading in the lettering is not a quality issue as that will happen even with machine made pieces and is beyond our control.","policy_additional":"Packaging & Gift Wrap: Items are placed in a silver organza bag, and a padded envelope for delivery. You can choose the option to add a brown kraft paper box for $2.\n\nCustom Orders: I will happily try to fill any custom orders. If it is a small order of one or two items please see the &quot;Custom Items&quot; section in my store to see if the item you are requesting already has a listing. For larger or more specialty orders please contact me via convo and I will put up a custom listing for you.\n\nLarge Order Discounts: We are a small business of only a few employees, and we believe in paying our employees a living wage. That means we cannot afford to offer discounts on orders under 10 pieces. \n\nWholesale Orders: If you&#39;d like to make a large purchase from the store please contact me via convo to discuss minimum order numbers and pricing.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a part time business, so I only work on items 2-3 days a week. This will mean that there are times I won&#39;t be able to get back to your convo right away. I promise I&#39;m not ignoring you, I just have a full time job that takes up most of my time.\n\nPLEASE READ LISTINGS THOROUGHLY: They will list all the information I should need to get your order filled. With rings please make sure that you leave me a ring size preference as I cannot complete your order without that information. For custom orders please make sure you are explicit in every detail. If I need to contact you for information I will do so via Etsy Convo (so please make sure to whitelist Etsy so messages don&#39;t end up in your spam folder), and your order will be delayed until the next day that week that I will be working on production. I receive many orders every day and do not have time to continuously chase people for information. So once an Etsy Convo is sent an order will not be filled until it is responded to. If you do not check your Etsy convo for weeks or even months I cannot be held responsible for the delay in fulfillment of your order.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1516665298,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":"THIS IS AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE:\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays!
